Mazes Demonstration
====================
Utilizing python and pygame to visually demonstrate randmoized maze generation and algorithms that can be used to solve these mazes.

Changelog
-----------
###8 Jan 2014
* +Finished implementing randomized DFS as an extra maze generation algorithm
* +Moved algorithm methods to their own class

###7 Jan 2014
* +Finished implementing Randmoized Prim's algorithm to generate mazes
* +Finished drawing of maze

To-do
-----------
* Basic implemenation an algorithm to solve the maze (A*?)
* Scaling of cell and wall sizes for easier viewing
* Otimization and other maze-generation methdods ?
* Rewriting algorithm methods to keep coding style consistant
